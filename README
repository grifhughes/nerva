# Nerva

Nerva is a 2-layer nerual network implementation for Intel CPUs written in C.  It utilizes the Intel MKL's CBLAS routines to compute the forward and backward 
passes.  Currently, the net uses the relu activation function + a softmax output layer, along with vanilla SGD and L2 regularization for training.  The training 
data is also Gaussian normalized.
